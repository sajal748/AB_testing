# AB_testing

In A/B testing, we compare the outcomes of two marketing techniques in order to select the best one for future marketing campaigns. For example, when I launched my first Instagram ad campaign to promote an Instagram post, my target audience was different from the target audience of my second ad campaign. After analysing the outcomes of both ad campaigns, I always favoured the second ad campaign's audience since it provided more reach and followers than the first.
